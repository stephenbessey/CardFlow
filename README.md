# Semester Project Requirements Document

## Project Title: CardFlow
## Developer Name: Stephen Bessey

## Business Context

CardFlow enables secure electronic bank-to-bank financial transactions for payments and refunds while protecting client and business banking information. The primary driver for this software is the need to make online payment transactions between merchants and banks more streamlined and efficient.

### Description of the Domain:
This e-commerce system performs payment processing (credit & debit), order tracking, and transaction management for both users and businesses involved in each transaction. The system will be used by businesses collecting payments through credit cards, including e-commerce platforms and restaurants. Key stakeholders include merchants, customers, and banks/financial institutions.

## Problem Statement

The current payment processing landscape involves millions of merchants needing to interact with thousands of banks, creating complexity and security risks. We need to construct a solution where merchants don't have to interact directly with banks. The system will act as a clearinghouse that translates and secures these transactions, abstracting the complexity of bank interactions from merchants while maintaining security and reliability.

## Scope

### In Scope:
- Credit card authorization and validation
- Secure storage of card data
- Payment gateway functionality
- Transaction logging
- Administrative interface
- API integration capabilities
- Multiple payment method support
- Transaction summaries
- Integration with major credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex)
- Support for both credit and debit transactions

### Out of Scope:
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Loyalty program integration (points/rewards)
- Non-standard payment methods (QR codes, Venmo)
- Foreign currency transactions
- Refund/chargeback processing
- Fraud detection systems
- Merchant dashboard
- Customer portal
